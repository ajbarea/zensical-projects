# Getting Started

## Prerequisites

| Requirement | Version | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| **Python** | 3.12+ | Required by `a2a-sdk` |
| **[uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/)** | Latest | Fast Python packaging with workspace support |
| **Docker + Docker Compose** | Any | Required to run agents and observability stack |
| **API Key** | — | Anthropic API key, or use [Ollama](https://ollama.com/) for free local models |

---

## Installation

### 1. Clone and install

```bash title="Terminal"
git clone https://github.com/ajbarea/kourai_khryseai.git
cd kourai_khryseai

# Install all workspace packages
make setup
# (equivalent to: uv sync --all-packages)
```

??? tip "Multiple terminals / OS environments (WSL, Docker, Windows)"

    `make setup` automatically selects the right virtual environment for your platform:

    | Environment | venv folder |
    |---|---|
    | WSL | `.venv-wsl` |
    | Windows (Git Bash / PowerShell) | `.venv-win` |
    | Docker | `.venv` (inside container only) |

    If you run `uv sync` directly (without `make`), set `UV_PROJECT_ENVIRONMENT` in your shell profile to match the table above — otherwise `uv` defaults to `.venv` and collides across environments.

### 2. Configure environment

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Edit `.env` and add your API key:

```bash title=".env"
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-your-key-here
```

??? tip "Using Ollama instead (free, no API key)"

    Install [Ollama](https://ollama.com/), pull the models, and set:

    ```bash
    KOURAI_PROVIDER=local
    ```

    See [Configuration → LLM Models](configuration.md#llm-models) for the full model table.

## Starting the Agents

```bash
make up              # Build images + start full stack (waits for healthy services)
make status          # Show service state/health
```

Docker Compose profiles for fine control:

=== "Full Stack (recommended)"

    ```bash
    docker compose --profile full up
    ```
    All six agents + Jaeger + Prometheus.

=== "Specialists Only"

    ```bash
    docker compose --profile agents up
    ```
    Five specialists without Hephaestus orchestrator.

=== "Observability Only"

    ```bash
    docker compose up jaeger
    ```
    Just Jaeger for trace inspection.

---

## Your First Request

Launch the interactive CLI:

```bash
make cli
```

You'll see the Kourai Khryseai banner and a prompt:

```
╔══════════════════════════════════════════╗
║     Kourai Khryseai — Golden Maidens     ║
╚══════════════════════════════════════════╝
Type your request. Commands: :q (quit), :status (agent info)

Connecting to Hephaestus at http://localhost:10000/...
Connected to Hephaestus — Orchestrator v0.1.0
Skills: Route Development Request, Execute Development Pipeline

kourai:
```

Type a request in plain English:

```bash
# Full pipeline: plan → code → test → lint → commit messages
kourai: implement CSV export with tests

# Fix a bug
kourai: fix the null check in auth.py

# Add tests
kourai: add tests for the payment module

# Style cleanup
kourai: clean up comments in src/utils/

# Just commit messages
kourai: commit prep
```

Hephaestus automatically routes your request to the right pipeline of specialists. You'll see real-time progress with agent emojis as each step completes.

See the [CLI Reference](cli.md) for all commands and options.

### Using the GUI

For a richer, visual experience, launch the full-screen GUI:

```bash
make gui
```

This opens an anime-styled visual interface with:
- **Full-color portraits** of each agent (1280×720 JRPG aesthetic)
- **Dialogue bubbles** with real-time responses
- **Personality-matched voices** with neural speech synthesis
- **Scrollable chat history** with agent switching
- **Settings overlay** for voice customization and accessibility

The GUI speaks all agent responses through natural neural voices (Microsoft Edge TTS with real-time volume/pitch control).

#### Quick TTS Test

```python title="Quick voice demo"
from hosts.gui.tts_engine import TTSEngine
import asyncio

async def demo():
    engine = TTSEngine(master_volume=0.8)
    for agent in ['kallos', 'metis', 'hephaestus']:
        print(f'Speaking as {agent}...')
        await engine.speak(f'Hello! I am {agent}.', agent_name=agent)
    engine.cleanup()

asyncio.run(demo())
```

See [GUI Reference → Text-to-Speech System](gui.md#text-to-speech-system-) for voice customization, personality profiles, and advanced audio options.

---

## Viewing Traces

Every request creates a distributed trace across all agents. Jaeger starts automatically with `make up`.

Open the Jaeger UI at [`localhost:16686`](http://localhost:16686) and select any agent from the service dropdown to see its spans, timings, and any errors.

---

## Stopping the Agents

```bash
make down
```
